## Key Steps and Contents

### Data Setup and Core KPIs:

* **Connect data** and create calculated fields (e.g., Attrition Rate).
* **Design KPI cards** for essential metrics like **Total Employee Count**, **Attrition Rate**, and **Average Employee Age**.
* **Set up** the custom dashboard size and background design.

### Initial Visualizations and Interactivity:

* Build foundational charts like the **Lollipop Chart** for Attrition by Gender.
* Create a **Frequency Bar Chart** for the Number of Employees by Age Group, using a **parameter** to allow users to dynamically adjust the age bin size.

### Advanced Analysis and Detail Charts:

* Design a **Pie Chart** for Attrition by Department.
* Develop a **Heat Map (Matrix Chart)** to visualize employee satisfaction ratings across different job roles.
* Create **Multiple Donut Charts** to show gender-based attrition within specific age bands.

### Finalizing the Dashboard:

* **Apply detailed formatting** to ensure a clean, professional aesthetic.
* **Implement complete interactivity** using a global Quick Filter and setting up **Action Filters** across all charts.
